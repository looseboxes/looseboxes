      No bride wants to walk down the aisle without making a fashion statement 
      or at least leave an impression on the guest, not to mention, leaving her 
      groom awed and flabbergasted, she also knows that, years down the line, the 
      gown will still be <tt>the topic of discussion</tt>, by their children and 
      visitors to their family home. Justifiably, the much ado about her wedding dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how does a bride to be go about selecting the perfect dress? While there 
      are no hard and fast rules to follow, the underlined are a general guide 
      to picking the right dress for her.

      gown is, if it does not compliment your body shape, the gown will just be 
      that: a pretty wedding gown. From looking at the descriptive pictures and 
      their description, you'll identify with one. After knowing your body shape, 
      look up what styles fit you <tt>(you could do that 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/Resource_Style-Fashion-Guide-Figure-Flattery-Find-Your-Shape?contentName=/Left_Nav/Style_and_Fashion_Guide/styleguide_dressguide/index">here</a>)</tt>

      empire wedding gown as they accentuate her waist and hide the hips.

      <b>White, Ivory, Cream or Colored?</b><br/><br/>
      Traditionally, wedding gowns are white, but thank God it's YOUR wedding day 
      and you can decide what color it should be, choose a color that suits you.

      <b>The Right Lingerie!</b><br/><br/>
      What you wear under your gown is equally as important as the wedding gown. 
      They actually accentuate and flatter the wedding gown. Ensure you shop for 
      lingeries that  flatter your body; cup your chests properly, mould your 
      stomach and hips so the gowns can lie flatter. Don't forget to get the 
      right crinoline, these is where most brides get it wrong, ask the  bridal 
      shop where you're getting the gown to recommend the proper crinoline for 
      your dress.
