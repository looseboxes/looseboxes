<strong>Delivery time depends on which wholesaler you are buying from:</strong>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Across Continents: </strong>
    Favourably priced items are often offered by wholesalers based in Dubai, Asia 
    and sometimes Europe. If you live in Africa, it would usually take 
    <strong>10-30</strong> days for delivery.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Local Wholesaler: </strong>
    If the wholesaler resides in the same country then it would usually take 
    <strong>1-3</strong>  working days.  
    </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Final Say: </strong> The final say rests with the wholesaler and this 
    should usually be indicated in the productâ€™s details. Feel free to contact the 
    wholesaler directly. <a href="../help/FAQs.jsp#contactseller">click here</a>

  <li>
    <strong>Another Option: </strong> 
   Place a request (without paying) for an item <a href="../help/FAQs.jsp#request">(how to place a request)</a>. 
   If there is reasonable 
   demand for an item, ${siteName} will provide the added service of importing the 
   item. You can request for any item, even those not indicated on the website.
