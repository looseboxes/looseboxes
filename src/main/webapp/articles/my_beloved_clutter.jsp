    <p>
      When an items <tt>useful</tt> life comes to an end, and it remains in the 
      home/office, it becomes junk. No matter how useful it might have been or 
      dear it was (and whatever wonderful memories), it still remains junk. It 
      takes up unnecessary space, distorts the home/office decor and most often 
      becomes a habitat for creepy crawlers. So why keep it?    
    </p>    
    <p>
      <b>Decide</b><br/><br/>    
      Once you've decided to replace an item, make efforts to dispose the replaced 
      item. Most times you believe you might still put it to work in some way but 
      you need time to figure out how to; you won't, most times rarely. This is 
      what causes junks, it becomes one too many.
    </p>

      <b>Auction Anyone?</b><br/><br/>    
      Auctions at <a target="_blank" href="http://olx.com">olx.com</a> etc
      are a great way to get rid of stuff and make money at the same time.
      Your cluster might just be someone's raw material or replacement. Give it 
      a try. Who knows the sales price could cut in half its replacement cost.    
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Give it Away</b><br/><br/>    
      If selling/auctions did not work, give it away. Someone will need it. Items 
      like well kept cloths and kids toys are great for giving away. There are 
      orphanages and families who will appreciate your kind gesture, make some 
      kids happy and put a smile on their face and yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Or Recycle It</b><br/><br/>    
      Ha, I know, that's what caused the clutter in the first place. But there 
      are some items which can and should be recycled. Bottles, plastics, papers,
      should be sold to recycling companies. There are also local men who go 
      about collecting stuffs, take advantage of them.
    </p>
    Here's a list of some Recycling Companies.<br/>

    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Throw it Away</b><br/><br/>    
      Some items just need to be thrown away. They are junk, clear up your 
      home/office by sorting out these items, those that you know can't be sold 
      or given out should be thrown away, it's really as simple as that.
